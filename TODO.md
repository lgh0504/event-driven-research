## TODO
### portability
1. add shell scripts for data and code synchronization
2. add shell scripts for environment variables setting up
3. make the code more environment irrelevant (like path)

### better data source
1. making the training sample more reasonable
2. better filtering rules
3. better tokenizing(remove urls)

### faster model iterating
1. make the model code more flexible for easy modification
2. using tensorflow mechanism to make the training process faster

### analysis tools
1. using tf.summary mechanism to track the training process
2. develop some data analyzing tools
